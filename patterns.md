1. Small Universal Computation Modules (e.g., XOR gates, NOT gates)
Size: ~1000×1000 or smaller

Type: Signal logic using gliders, reflectors, and eaters

Behavior: Takes input gliders, processes logic, and emits output gliders

Cool Factor:

You can build AND, OR, XOR gates with glider interactions.

Turing-complete logic inside a modest space.

Perfect fit: Can chain gates and simulate basic circuits.

2. Loafer Spaceship
Size: ~400×400

Discovered by: Josh Ball (2013)

Behavior: A natural diagonal spaceship (speed c/7)

Cool Factor:

First spaceship discovered in 30 years.

Elegant and slow-moving.

Perfect fit: Multiple loafers can cruise around a grid under 2000×2000.

3. Constructible Oscillators and Reflector Factories
Size: <1500×1500

Type: Oscillators that emit construction recipes or build reflectors

Examples:

Puffer trains generating debris

Snark loop oscillator factories

Cool Factor:

Shows synthesis and cyclic engineering in a small footprint.

Can be used to demonstrate “machine” style behavior.
